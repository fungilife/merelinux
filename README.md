# Mere Linux
Mere Linux is a simple Linux distribution built upon
[musl](http://www.musl-libc.org/) libc, using
[pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/) for package management and
[s6](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/) for PID 1 and process supervision.

Mere is still in its Alpha phase. If you are interested in helping to
shape its direction, please visit the
[Github Discussions](https://github.com/jhuntwork/merelinux/discussions/58)
page and leave a comment.
