      Mere Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution built around
      [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/) and
      [s6](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/) for system initialization and
      process supervision.\

      \

      It also uses [pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/)
      for package management, [busybox](https://busybox.net) for a suite of
      core utilities, and [llvm+clang](https://llvm.org) as the main C
      compiler and toolchain.\

      \

      Mere is still in its Alpha phase. If you are interested in helping to
      shape its direction, please visit the
      [Github Discussions](https://github.com/jhuntwork/merelinux/discussions/58)
      page and leave a comment.
